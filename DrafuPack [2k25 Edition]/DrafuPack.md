# 🐉 DrafuPack

**DrafuPack** is our refreshed take on Minecraft — staying true to the beloved vanilla vibe, but with just the right amount of spice to keep things exciting again.

## 🌍 About

After years of playing vanilla Minecraft, we realized we needed a little refresh. So we added just a few (read: 80) mods — but nothing too crazy or out of place. We focused on the essentials:

- Revamped structures thanks to **YUNG’s Mods**
- More biomes via **Biomes O’ Plenty**
- Unique little flavors like **Fish of Thieves**
- All carefully balanced to keep that classic Minecraft feeling

We created DrafuPack2025 because we wanted to play Minecraft with friends — but in a way that felt different from any of our past attempts. Not just another modpack, but one that felt fresh, exciting, and *ours*.


## ✨ Visual Improvements

We aimed to beautify Minecraft — without losing its soul:

- **Fresh Animations** – smoother, more lively character movement
- **Emotes and capes** – express yourself in style
- **Restored models and textures** – a nostalgic touch with a fresh look
- **Shaders** – optional, but highly recommended 💎

## 🏅 Honorable Mentions

**Xaero’s World Map & Minimap** — Explore smarter and smoother with fully integrated, fully immersive Xaero’s mods.

## ⚙️ Modpack Versions

DrafuPack comes in two preconfigured flavors:

- **Low** – for lower-end machines that want the refreshed gameplay without visual enhancements
- **High** – the full immersive experience with visuals, shaders, and all the extra magic 
- **Server** - server package that fully support your multiplayer adventure <3
