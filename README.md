**DrafuPack** is  custom-built Minecraft modpack — designed with love for the vanilla feel, but enhanced to keep things fresh, fun, and exciting. The mods for this one were carefully picked by me and [@Februu](https://github.com/februu) for our own survival server. They mostly focus on world generation - adding new biomes and new structures. There are also some QoL changes that will make your life much better.
